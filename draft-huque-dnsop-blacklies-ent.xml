    <abstract>
     <t>
      The Black Lies method of providing compact DNSSEC denial of
      existence proofs has some operational implications. Depending
      on the specific implementation, it may provide no way to reliably
      distinguish Empty Non-Terminal names from names that actually do
      not exist. This draft describes the use of a synthetic DNS resource
      record type to act as an explicit signal for Empty Non-Terminal
      names and which is conveyed in an NSEC type bitmap.

      <name>Introduction and Motivation</name>
      <t>
        One of the functions of the Domain Name System Security Extensions
        (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" /> <xref target="RFC4034" />
        <xref target="RFC4035" /> is "Authenticated Denial of Existence",
        i.e. proving that a DNS name or record type does not exist.
        Normally, this is done by means of NSEC or NSEC3 records. In the
        precomputed signature model, these records chain together existing
        names, or cryptographic hashes of them in the zone. In the online
        signing model, they are used to dynamically compute an epsilon
        function around the queried name.
      </t>
      <t>
        An alternative method, <xref target="BLACKLIES" format="default">
        Black Lies</xref>, described in an expired Internet draft, provides
        more compact denial of existence proofs for online signers by relying
        on a clever hack. For non-existent names, it claims that the name
        exists, but has no resource records associated with the queried
        type, i.e. it returns a NODATA response rather than an NXDOMAIN
        response. A NODATA response (which has a response code of NOERROR,
        and an empty ANSWER section) requires only one NSEC record matching
        the queried name. This has two advantages: the DNS response sizes
        are smaller, and it reduces the online cryptographic work involved
        in generating the responses. By contrast, an NXDOMAIN response
        requires multiple records (up to 2 when using NSEC, and up to 3
        when using NSEC3) to prove that (1) the name did not explicitly
        exist in the zone, and (2) that it could not have been synthesized
        by a wildcard.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Black Lies method has some operational implications. Tools
        that rely on the correctness of the DNS response code (e.g.
        obtaining NXDOMAIN for non-existent domains) no longer work.
        Arguably, we should not be doing this anyway, since the response
        code in the DNS header cannot be authenticated. This means that
        NXDOMAIN has to be "inferred" from signed records in the DNS
        response. Whether this inference can be reliably drawn depends
        on other details of the Black Lies implementation. A Black Lies
        NODATA response contains only "NSEC" and "RRSIG" in the NSEC
        type bitmap. This is not sufficient to infer NXDOMAIN though,
        because Empty Non-Terminal (ENT) responses (which positively
        exist) will return the exact same response. DNS operators often
        rely on precisely distinguishing NXDOMAIN from NODATA, including
        ENT responses (such as tools that prevent the creation of zone
        cuts or DNAME records at ENTs to avoid accidentally occluding
        names underneath them - these have been critical safety features
        of our DNS record provisioning systems).
      </t>
      <t>
        Of the 3 implementations I've examined, NS1 (previously) and
        Amazon Route53 suffer from this NXDOMAIN/ENT indistinguishability.
        Cloudflare avoids this problem by synthesizing the NSEC type
        bitmap for ENTs to include all (?) RR Types they support. This
        has the side effect though of no longer being able to reliably
        determine the existence of ENTs.

      <name>Synthetic Type for Empty Non-Terminal Names</name>
      <t>
        This document proposes the use of a synthetic Resource Record
        type to signal the presence of an Empty Non-Terminal name.
        This RR type is added to the NSEC type bitmap for responses
        to ENTs. Currently, the deployed examples of this scheme
        are using the private RR type code 65281. So the resulting
        type bitmap would have "NSEC RRSIG TYPE65281". Should this
        document be published, a formal request for an RR type number
        could be made.
      </t>
      <t>
        NS1 has implemented this scheme in their Managed DNS platform.
        The following is an example of a response to an Empty Non-
        Terminal name hosted on their service:

      <name>Status of Black Lies specification</name>
      <t>
        Despite the fact that Black Lies is not standardized or even
        formally published as a protocol specification, it seems to be
        gaining in popularity and deployment. At least 3 major DNS
        providers (Cloudflare, NS1 and Amazon Route53) have deployed it.
        Due to the fact that Black Lies relies on contorting existing
        semantics of the DNS protocol, it seems unlikely that it could
        be published as a "Standards Track" specification. But given
        deployment realities, it seems desirable to have a stable
        specification published for it, even if its status is
        Informational.
